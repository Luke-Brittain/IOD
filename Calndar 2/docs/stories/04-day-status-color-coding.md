# User Story: 4 - Day Status Color Coding

**As a** user,
**I want** days in the calendar to be color-coded by task completion status,
**so that** I can quickly see which days need attention and which are complete.

## Acceptance Criteria

* Days with no tasks or with tasks none started display a grey style.
* Days with some tasks completed (but not all) display an orange style.
* Days with all tasks completed display a green style.
* The color updates immediately when tasks are added, marked done, or deleted.
* A small legend explaining the colors is available in the UI.

## Notes

* Colors should meet basic accessibility contrast where practical; exact palette can be refined.
