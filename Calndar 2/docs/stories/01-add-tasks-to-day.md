# User Story: 1 - Add Tasks To A Day

**As a** user,
**I want** to add, view, and remove tasks for a specific calendar day,
**so that** I can track and manage what I need to do each day.

## Acceptance Criteria

* A control is available to open a day's task panel from the calendar view (e.g., clicking the day).
* The user can add a new task with a short text description for the selected day.
* Added tasks are listed immediately in the day's task panel.
* The user can delete a task from the day's list.
* The user can toggle a task as completed/uncompleted and the UI updates immediately.
* Validation prevents adding empty tasks.

## Notes

* This story should include a minimal UI (panel or modal) for per-day task CRUD and visual feedback when tasks change.
