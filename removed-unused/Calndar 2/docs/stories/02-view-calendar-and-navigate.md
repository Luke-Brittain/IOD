# User Story: 2 - View Calendar And Navigate Months

**As a** user,
**I want** to view a monthly calendar and navigate between months,
**so that** I can browse days, open a specific day, and plan tasks across dates.

## Acceptance Criteria

* A month label is visible showing month and year.
* Controls exist to move to the previous and next month.
* The calendar displays a grid with the correct day-of-week alignment for the month.
* Clicking a day opens the day's task panel (or equivalent UI) to see/add tasks.
* The calendar layout is responsive on desktop and mobile viewports.

## Notes

* The story includes the basic calendar rendering and navigation; task details are handled in other stories.
