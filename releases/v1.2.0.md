# v1.2.0 — Phase 2: import-csv stabilization

Released: 2026-02-08

## Summary

Stabilize the generated CSV import handler used by the Next.js app router. This release recovers and canonicalizes a previously corrupted generated stub, restores route wiring, and verifies import-route behavior with tests.

## Changelog

### Fixed
- Recovered and stabilized the generated CSV import handler. Replaced a corrupted concatenated artifact with a canonical single-line re-export to `importCsvHandlerClean.ts` and ensured the route forwards to the canonical stub.
- Removed temporary corrupted backup file `importCsvStub.corrupted.ts`.

### Verification
- All `OliveBranch` tests pass locally: 8 test files, 17 tests.

## Notes
- Branch: `feature/import-csv-stub-stabilize` (merged into `main`).
- Tag: `v1.2.0` (annotated tag pushed to `origin`).

## Publishing
To publish this draft as a GitHub release (requires `gh` CLI or GitHub API access):
