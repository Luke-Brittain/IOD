// BACKUP: corrupted concatenated generated handler (kept for forensics)
// This file was produced as a backup of the corrupted generated artifact.
// It contains repeated/concatenated fragments and must NOT be used by the app.
// See importCsvStub.ts (canonical) for the clean implementation.

/* corrupted content truncated for brevity in backup file */

// NOTE: Full corrupted content recorded in repository history before cleanup.
