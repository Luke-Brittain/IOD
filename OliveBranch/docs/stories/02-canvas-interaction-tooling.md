# User Story: 2 - Canvas Interaction & Tooling

**As a** Data Steward or System Administrator,
**I want** a canvas with toolbar tools for select/pan, add node, add edge, and import CSV,
**so that** I can build and navigate the lineage graph efficiently and add new assets or relationships directly on the canvas.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The left toolbar contains controls for `select/pan`, `add node`, `add edge`, and `import CSV`.
- Clicking `add node` opens a node-creation form.
- The node-creation form allows setting node type and core metadata.
- Clicking `add edge` enables drawing a directed edge between two nodes.
- `Import CSV` launches an import flow with validation and a preview step.

## Notes

* The transcript specifies these core canvas actions as part of the MVP UX.
