# User Story: 12 - Details Panel: Display Core & Business Metadata

**As a** Data Analyst or Steward,
**I want** the details panel to show core metadata and any business-defined fields for a node,
**so that** I can quickly read the node's important properties and business context.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The panel lists the node's `name`, `node type`, and `stable key`.
- The panel shows `created` and `updated` timestamps.
- Business-defined fields appear in a distinct section labeled "Business Metadata".
- Each field includes a label; where available, a field description/help text is shown.

## Notes

* This story covers read-only display of metadata; editing is handled in a separate story.
