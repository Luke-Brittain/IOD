# User Story: 13 - Details Panel: Relationship Summary & Navigation

**As a** Data Analyst,
**I want** the details panel to show upstream/downstream relationship counts and navigation links,
**so that** I can understand an asset's lineage surface and jump to related nodes quickly.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The panel shows the count of upstream relationships.
- The panel shows the count of downstream relationships.
- Each related node in the summary has a control to navigate to it on the canvas.
- Navigating to a related node highlights it on the canvas.
- Optionally, the canvas recenters on the navigated node when the user chooses that behavior.

## Notes

* This story is a vertical slice combining display and navigation behaviour.
