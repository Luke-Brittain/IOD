# User Story: 8 - Canvas Filters & Toggles

**As a** Data Steward or Analyst,
**I want** filters and toggles (node types, show/hide governance nodes, PII-only),
**so that** I can reduce visual noise and focus on the assets relevant to my task.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The UI presents filter controls for selecting node types to show/hide.
- The UI includes a toggle to show or hide Person-in-Role (governance) nodes.
- The UI includes a `PII-only` filter that limits results to nodes/fields with `PII = Yes`.
- Active filters are displayed and can be cleared individually.
- Multiple filters can be combined and the canvas updates accordingly.

## Notes

* Filter options are listed in the transcript as part of the left toolbar capabilities.
