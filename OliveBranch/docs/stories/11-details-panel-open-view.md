# User Story: 11 - Details Panel: Open Panel on Double-click

**As a** Canvas user,
**I want** to open a right-side details panel by double-clicking a node,
**so that** I can inspect that node without leaving the canvas view.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Double-clicking a node opens the right-side details panel.
- The panel opens for all node types: System, Dataset, Table, Field, Metric, Person-in-Role.
- Opening the panel does not alter the graph layout.
- Opening the panel preserves the current selection unless the user explicitly selects another node.

## Notes

* This is the minimal UI interaction slice for the details panel experience.
