# User Story: 6 - Stewardship Display for Dataset & Table

**As a** Data Steward,
**I want** stewardship to be supported and visible for Dataset and Table nodes,
**so that** responsibilities for those assets are clear and discoverable from the UI.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Dataset nodes accept zero or more Steward relationships to Person-in-Role nodes.
- Table nodes accept zero or more Steward relationships to Person-in-Role nodes.
- The details panel lists Steward(s) for Dataset and Table nodes.
- Stewards can be added via the canvas `add edge` flow or via CSV import.

## Notes

* Transcript states stewardship applies only to Datasets and Tables in the MVP.
