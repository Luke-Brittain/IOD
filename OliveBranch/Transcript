For cross-system ambiguity at “report/metric level,” Olive Branch will adopt Option A: Primary System anchor in the near-term evolution path. Option B (Accountability overlay) is explicitly reserved as a future enhancement.

1) Product summary

Olive Branch is a manual-first data lineage + data catalogue where governance is native to the model and the UI.

Graph model: assets and governance people-in-role are nodes; relationships are edges.

Core UI: lineage canvas with a left toolbar and double-click → right details panel.

MVP ingestion: CSV template upload + manual editing. No DB connections in MVP.

Default experience: role-scoped “lay of the land” graph expanded until no more edges with a cap.

2) Users and roles

Base roles:

Data Governance Lead

System Administrator

Data Owner

Data Steward

Governance is represented as Person-in-Role nodes (Name + Role) so users can identify contact points directly from lineage.

3) Governance rules (MVP)

System-level ownership only. A system has an owner; all child assets inherit ownership.

Stewardship applies only to Datasets and Tables (not Fields or Metrics).

PII is mandatory at Field level and is Yes/No (manual).

CSV import merges and preserves manual changes.

Landing view is role-scoped, expanded until edges exhausted with a cap.

4) Data model
Node types

System

Dataset

Table

Field

Calculated Metric

Governance Person-in-Role (Name + Role)

Edge types

Structural / lineage:

contains (System→Dataset/Table, Dataset/Table→Field)

derived from (Asset→Asset, Metric→Asset)

Governance:

owns (Person-in-role→System only)

stewards (Person-in-role→Dataset/Table only)

5) Metadata model

Built-in mandatory

Field.PII (Yes/No)

Node name

Business-defined fields (configured by DG Lead/Admin)

Global fields (all node types)

Per-node-type fields (distinct per node type)

Field types: text, boolean, single-select, multi-select

Required/optional per field

Shown in:

Node details panel

CSV templates

6) Core UX (MVP)
A) Landing: role-scoped “lay of the land”

User lands on a subgraph centered on their Person-in-Role node, including owned/stewarded assets and connected lineage. Expansion continues until no edges remain, constrained by a configurable cap. When cap is hit, the UI offers “Expand more.”

B) Canvas interaction

Left toolbar provides:

select/pan

add node

add edge

import CSV

filters/toggles (node types, show/hide governance nodes, PII-only filter)

C) Details panel (double-click)

Right panel displays:

core metadata + business-defined metadata

relationship summary (upstream/downstream, containment)

governance section (owner inherited from system; stewards on dataset/table)

7) CSV import behaviour (merge-preserving)

Upsert by stable keys

Blank values do not overwrite existing values

Edges are additive by default (no deletions unless explicitly supported later)

Evolution path: handling cross-system ambiguity (locked)
Option A — Primary System anchor (adopted)

For Calculated Metrics (and future “Report” nodes), Olive Branch will support a Primary System attribute:

Metric/Report accountability is anchored to one system.

Ownership continues to flow via inheritance: Owner = Owner(Primary System).

The lineage graph can still show multi-system derivations; the Primary System is the governance anchor.

Future enhancement (explicit)

Option B — Accountability overlay (a distinct governance relationship for cross-system outputs) remains a future-phase add-on once the organisation needs more nuance than Primary System can provide.
